        <p className="text-center">
Before joing the world of coding, I was a technician at BMW. But now, I'm exploring the world of coding. I joined a bootcamp to learn because I want a new career. Coding is like solving puzzles, and I'm enjoying the challenge. It's different from what I did before, but I'm excited to see where it takes me. </p>
